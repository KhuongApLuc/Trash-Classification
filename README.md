# DenseNet-in-Trash-Classification

🧠 Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates an image classification pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data preprocessing, data augmentation, model building, training, and evaluation.

📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher. To install the required libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, install manually:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python imutils scikit-learn tensorflow

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd project-folder

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare your dataset:
Organize your dataset into folders by class inside data/, for example:

data/
├── class_1/
├── class_2/
└── ...

Train the model:

python train.py

📌 Notes

Training uses ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation.

Model includes convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.

ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping are used during training.
